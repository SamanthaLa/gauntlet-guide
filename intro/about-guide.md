Written by Valerie for the members of the Rainbow Collective Discord server. You can find me on discord at valra#6911, and any feedback or suggestions are welcome!

This guide details my own personal experiences with The Gauntlet, and I encourage you to explore and try out new things. This is by no means a definitive guide.
