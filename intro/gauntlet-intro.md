[The Gauntlet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Gauntlet) is an activity that takes place in the Elven city of Prifddinas. In it, players are tasked with exploring a randomly generated dungeon to collect resources and supplies needed to fight the powerful boss that resides within. To make matters worse, you're only given a limited amount of time to prepare for the fight! The Gauntlet is one of the most challenging pieces of content in the game, but rewards you adequeately for the effort with gp and some of the most powerful equipment in the entire game.

## The Gauntlet vs The Corrupted Gauntlet
There are two varieties of challenges that you can choose to take on, [The Gauntlet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Gauntlet){: .g} and [The Corrupted Gauntlet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Gauntlet#Corrupted_Gauntlet){: .cg}. Specific differences will be gone over in more detail in later chapters, but the gist of the differences are:
- All monsters, including the boss, are substantially stronger
- Your time to prepare is reduced from <span>10</span>{: .g} to <span>7.5</span>{: .cg} minutes
- Some boss mechanics are tweaked to make the challenge more difficult

Players who master The Corrupted Gauntlet are rewarded for taking on the challenge, as the drop rates for all unique rewards are drastically increased as well as the [crystal shards](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crystal_shard) and alchables.

## Quest and Stat Requirements
To enter The Gauntlet, you must complete [Song of the Elves](https://olschool.runescape.wiki/w/Song_of_the_elves) to gain access to Prifddinas. You enter the lobby through [The Gauntlet Portal](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Gauntlet_Portal) located in the northwest part the city.

### Skill Requirements
Generally speaking, if you've completed Song of the Elves your stats should be acceptable for attempting <span>The Gauntlet</span>{: .g}. 70 Ranged and Magic are a good point to start from. <span>The Corrupted Gauntlet</span>{: .cg}, on the other hand, will generally be best attempted with combat stats >90. While it *can* be done with lower stats, the learning process will be exponentially more painful as the <span>Corrupted Hunllef</span> fight is brutal and punishing.

### Equipment/Gear Requirements
The Gauntlet is unique in that it has **no gear or supply requirements.** It is free to enter, and upon entering, all of your equipped gear and your inventory are temporarily stashed until you exit. Because of this, The Gauntlet heavily favors players with high stats and high skill, as they are the primary contributing factors. There is one exception to this however, being the raid prayers [rigour](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rigour) and [augury](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Augury). They are by no means mandatory, but having rigour will noticably improve the power of the bow and the speed of your kills.

## Rewards
Both version of The Gauntlet share the same rewards, but at different rates as mentioned above. Upon a successful completion, you are guaranteed:
- Crystal shards, guaranteed
- A few standard drops, which include alchables, gp, runes, arrows, uncut gems, and battlestaves

Additionally, you may recieve a rarer drop, which could be:
- [Elite clue scrolls](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll_(elite))
- [Crystal weapon seeds](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crystal_weapon_seed)
- [Crystal armor seeds](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crystal_armour_seed)
- [Enhanced Crystal Weapon Seed](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Enhanced_crystal_weapon_seed)
- [Yungllef](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Youngllef), the Hunllef pet

The most notable of these unique rewards are the crystal armor seeds and enhanced crystal weapon seeds. Armor seeds are used in creating [Crystal Armor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crystal_equipment#Crystal_armour), which gives bonus damage and accuracy for the [crystal bow](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crystal_bow) and [Bow of Faerdhinen](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bow_of_faerdhinen). The latter bow is one of two wepaons you can create from the enhanced crystal weapon seed, the other being the [Blade of Saeldor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blade_of_saeldor#Charged).
