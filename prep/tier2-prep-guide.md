Thie is how I consistently tier 2 prep every Gauntlet run with staff and bow, as well as a full inventory of food. This method works around 90% of the time I would say, with the 10% or so requiring a reset about 2 minutes into prep. I prefer tier 2 prep as it's consistent for me to do and makes the Hunllef fight substantially easier, virtually guaranteeing a kill. I am going to assume a staff + bow prep, but you may use a halberd if it's your preference, as it can save time to only grab the first two weapon materials you see.

## Overview
This is a 2 trip prep method, which means you'll make 2 trips out of the spawn room. The first trip is to collect armor materials and the second trip is to collect weapon materials and fish. Here's a rough outline of the method:

1. From spawn, open the nearest room
2. Collect any resources and kill any monsters until you get a weapon frame
3. Proceed with the "C" pattern, checking boss rooms and collecting resources until you have 7 of each armor material, 2 grym leaves, and at least 100 shards
4. Craft a tier 2 staff, 2 vials, and use the rest of your shards crafting armor
5. Drop ALL remaining armor materials
6. Kill demi-bosses while collecting fish along the way, as well as crafting your potions
7. Once you have your 2 weapon components and a full inventory of fish, teleport back
8. Craft 2 tier 3 weapons, and the rest of your tier 2 armor. You may need to drop some fish to make more room
9. Cook your fish
10. Wait for Hunllef to be in a good position, and enter the fight

## Detailed Guide
### First Trip Out
To start, you'll want to head into the first room next to the spawn room. Usually there will be a few creatures or some resources. Start harvesting resources, and bonk any creatures you see until they drop a weapon frame, after which they can be ignored. Collect up to 7 of each resource, and drop the tool used to collect it once you have them.

When you're collecting your 7th resource of one type, it may be worth collecting and then dropping the remaining 2 resources in the node for a chance at getting more shards.

![starting-inventory](/assets/starting-inventory.png){: .align-left} In your first rooms, it helps to organize your inventory. You can drag items around without interrupting combat or collecting. Here's how I like to organize mine.
{: style="display:flex"}

By the end of your first trip, you will ideally have:
1. A weapon frame
2. 100+ Crystal shards (tier 2 weapon + 2 vials)
3. 7 of each armor material
4. 2 Grym leaves

It's okay if you don't get 2 Grym leaves, you can always pick them up later. It's also okay to have 7 armor materials from 2 types and either 3 or 6 in the last type, you will just need to remember to collect the remaining materials on the second trip. If possible, fill the empty spots with fish on your way back. If you do not have at least 7 of 2 types and 3 of the last type, you need to reset, though following the route extensions below this is rarely an issue.

If you don't have all of your resources by the end of the C, extend the path out as shown in the second image. If you still don't have all of your resources, extend the path again per the third image. If you don't get them by then, you need to restart." %}{: .full}

![full-inventory](/assets/trip1-full-inventory.png){: .align-left} Here's what an ideal first trip inventory looks like. You should be able to achieve this most runs, though some runs you may be short on 1-4 materials of a single type.

At the singing bowl in spawn:
1. Craft a tier 2 staff
2. Look at your shards. If you have at least 60, then craft a body, otherwise, drop ALL of your armor materials
3. Craft 2 vials (you may 3 if using CoX prayers)
4. Use up your remaining shards crafting armor pieces, in the order of chest > legs > helmet. Remember that tier 1 pieces cost 40 shards and tier 2 cost 60
5. Drop all of your remaining armor materials at the singing bowl

## Second Trip
1. If you scouted a demiboss on the first trip, prepare to head for it
2. If there aren't fishing spots en route or near the demi, fill your vials in the spawn room. Not doing so risks running out of stamina
3. Head for the demi. If you didn't see one while scouting, head for one of the other demi rooms along the other sides of the dungeon. Pick a route that passes through fishing spots, if possible
4. Craft your potions while you run around. Drop your pestle and mortar once you're done crushing crystal shards and optionally after you've crushed the weapon component you don't want or get the other two that you do want
5. Rotate around the map killing demis until you have your two weapon materials and a full or near-full inventory of fish
6. When you're nearing the end of the trip, you'll want to do some mental math to figure out if you have enough shards or if you need to kill a medium tier monster. I'll explain this below
7. Teleport back to the spawn room
8. Drop your scepter and harpoon
9. Create your tier 3 weapons at the singing bowl
10. Drop a few fish to free up some inventory space
11. Pick up armor materials and finish crafting your armor
12. Pick up the remaining fish and cook them. Make combo fish if you so desire

Remember that you can crush unwanted weapon components. So if you are going for bow + staff it is still worth killing a bear if you see one. Since demis don't drop duplicate weapon components, killing 3 of any kind will always guarantee that you get all 3 weapon components.

{% capture notice-text %}
Count your shards before returning! Most of the time you'll have enough but every once in a while you'll get unlucky and need to kill a medium tier enemy (do not kill small ones unless you only need 20 or so shards).
You will need:
1. 80 Shards for your second weapon
2. 100 Shards for each empty armor slot
3. 60 Shards for each tier 1 armor slot
So for example, if you have no helmet, a tier 2 body, and tier 1 legs, you would need 80 (weapon) + 100 (helmet) + 60 (legs) = 240 shards

You should now have a minute or so to stand at the door and wait for Hunllef to walk into a corner. Good luck!
